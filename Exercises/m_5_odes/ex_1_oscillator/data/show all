 The `set` command can be used to set _lots_ of options.  No screen is
 drawn, however, until a `plot`, `splot`, or `replot` command is given.

 The `show` command shows their settings;  `show all` shows all the settings.

 Options changed using `set` can be returned to the default state by giving the
 corresponding `unset` command.  See also the `reset` command, which returns
 all settable parameters to default values.

 The `set` and `unset` commands may optionally contain an iteration clause.
 See `plot for`.
